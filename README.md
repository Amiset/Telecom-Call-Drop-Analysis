# ANALYSIS & FORECAST OF CALL DROPS IN CELLULAR NETWORK

### 1.  Background
1.1  Cellular communication operators are expected to provide a noiseless, uninterrupted voice and data service quality to its customers. This class of noiseless, uninterrupted service is technically ensured through provisioning Quality of Service (QoS) parameters across a cellular telecommunication network. The QoS parameters provide for the overall satisfactory performance of the network. 
1.2 Dropped Call Rate (DCR) is one of the parameters of QoS of a network and refers to the telephone calls which, due to technical reasons, were cut off before the speaking parties had finished their conversational tone and before one of them had physically disconnected the call or hung up. Technically speaking, it represents the service provider’s inability to maintain a call, either incoming or outgoing, once it has been correctly established. It is one of the major Key Performance Indices (KPIs) of a network and provides an insight into technical quality of the network.
1.3 Call drops being experienced by customers’ results in customer dissatisfaction, customer churn (discontinuation of service) and erosion of brand value. Ultimately it affects the revenue of a company and its growth since a telecom company needs to add more fresh customers to its subscriber base than it suffers through churn.

### 2.  Business Problem
2.1 The cellular network needs to guarantee a satisfactory quality of voice and data service to its customers, which is the primary product of the company. In the current competitive cellular telecommunication landscape wherein the customer has lucrative alternatives in terms of cellular service providers, inability to ensure quality and service leads to customer dissatisfaction and therefore churn. This has an adverse impact on the growth of the company as well as its brand value and reputation. The current business problem is as follows:-
(a) Currently call drops are being experienced across certain Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) in the network due to adverse weather situations.
(b) High DCR due to adverse weather conditions is one of the major compelling reasons for churn and needs to be identified and addressed.
(c) Deterioration in the product quality caused by a high DCR is unacceptable, hence this aspect needs to be mitigated/ minimized effectively.

2.2  Data on the call drops in these BTS (or cellular towers) primarily due to weather conditions is available. The data needs to be studied for identifying patterns so that technical measures are undertaken to address call drops pre-emptively or when call drops are experienced to prevent further incidences.

### 3.  Business Objective
3.1 The objectives have been defined as follows:-
(a) Study data related to the call drops as experienced across identified cellular towers of the network and ascertain patterns, probable causes and mitigation measures.
(b) Having identified the probable reasons, forecast prospective call drop situations for towers in the network.
(c) Suggest technical pre-emptive measures to be undertaken to mitigate the build-up of causes which lead to call drop.

3.2  A high performing network with superior QoS and devoid of call drops even in adverse weather conditions will help the company provide a qualitative edge to the customers over the competition. This will attract fresh customers to the services offered by the company and hence allow expansion in customer base as well as generate
revenue to expand the network itself.
